## Gotchas

Be patient! These firebase lambdas functions unfortunately take a long time to wake up from hibernation if they haven't been used for a long time. I am talking 5-10 seconds and maybe up to 20 seconds ðŸ’©. I haven't implemented spinners or alerts to notify the loading state yet. So I would at least wait 10 seconds when making CRUD operations.

## Extra Todos

- [ ] Add testing (Look at emulators)
- [ ] Wrap it in a docker container
- [ ] Make it fully responsive
- [ ] Handle Errors (Make the app not crash if not following the happy path)
- [ ] Make fields in DB unique (email and phone number)
- [ ] Allow users to choose a time when they can receive text messsages
- [ ] Make the app interactive. Send commands to the twilio phone number and receive something back
- [ ] And some more...
